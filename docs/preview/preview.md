# Preview

In this preview I just wanted to show the overall look and flow of my website. The pages right now do not have any content, I simply want to gauge whether my navigation is intuitive and whether the style of the website makes it feel clunky. I am showing you the base for me personal protfolio website, what I will be using to apply for jobs, I want it to look nice but I also want it to not be on a template. I'm not sure if that is possible. I am looking for feedback on whether I should keep the page how it is in the sense that it has mulitple pages, or if I should transition to one big scrolling website. My gut is telling me switching to a scrolling website would be beneficial, but I'm not sure. For the draft I'd like to have each of the pages filled out with content.
